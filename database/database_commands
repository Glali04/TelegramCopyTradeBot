here i will save every command which i used through database creation

creating a table
    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE finished_trades (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            user_id TEXT,       -- Track user performing the trade  *fetch_token_data -
            token_address TEXT,                                     *fetch_token_data +
            start_time TIMESTAMP,                                   *send_transaction +
            end_time TIMESTAMP,                                     *fetch_token_price +
            bought INTEGER,     -- In lamports                      *trade_execution +
            sold INTEGER,       -- In lamports                      *trade_execution +
            exit_reason TEXT    -- Reason for selling               *fetch_token_price +
        )
    """)

cursor.

*in which module we added value to this field in TrackedToken instance

async def insert_query(user_id: str, token_address: str, start_time: float, end_time: float, bought: int, sold: int,
                       exit_reason: str):
    async with aiosqlite.connect("database/finished_trades.db") as database:
        # in aiosqlite you do not need to create cursors explicitly, execute() internally creates and manages the cursor
        # for you only need a cursor when fetching results
